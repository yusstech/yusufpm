The Magic I Couldn't Ignore
There's a moment in product development I've always loved.
It's when you see all three pieces click together:

A real user problem
A technical solution that actually works
Business value that makes it worth building

That's the magic.
Most engineers don't see it. They're handed specs. Build the solution. Ship it. Next ticket.
I couldn't do that.
Across logistics, e-commerce, fintech, health tech, SaaS—no matter what I was building—I kept asking:
"Does this actually help users?"
"Will they pay for it?"
"Are we solving the right problem?"
Even as an engineer, I'd dig into user behavior. Look at analytics. Talk to customers. Understand the business model.
My teammates thought it was weird. My managers didn't always appreciate it.
But the products I helped build? They succeeded.
Not because the code was better. Because we were building the right things.
That's when I realized: I'm not just an engineer. I'm a product person who happens to know how to code.
The transition to PM was natural. I was already doing it—just without the title.
Now I get to live in that magic every day:
Understanding what users need (through research, data, conversations)

Knowing how to build it (because I speak engineering fluently)
Ensuring it drives business value (because good products make money)

Most people see one angle. Maybe two.
Engineers see technical solutions.
PMs see user needs.
Business people see revenue.
I see all three. Always have.
Because I couldn't ignore the magic when all three aligned.
And I've never been able to build something without asking: "Does this actually matter?"
